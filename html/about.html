                 <summary>Fatigue Risk Assessment</summary>
                 <p>A decision aide to assess risk based on the Tritschler model for an individual flight leg. 
                    Company risk models make sleep assumptions; whereas this tool uses actual sleep. Each check 
                    is worth one point. Ten or more points indicate high risk. Risk mitigation steps could 
                    include adding naps, caffeine usage, flight leg modification, etc. This is 
                    <span style="color: red;">NOT</span> a go / no-go tool.</p>

                 <summary>Substitution Considerations</summary>
                 <p>This tool is for trip holders to aide decision making when determining to SUB or not to SUB.
                    Entering the scheduled trip end and the revised trip end will provide a rough overage calulation
                    based purely on TAFB. Entering the SUB window Start / End will provide a recommendation for how to
                    handle your decision to remain in SUB or keep overage. There are many considerations and the 
                    decision to remain in SUB or not is up to the individaul pilot.

                 <summary>Deviation Banks</summary>
                 <p>This tool will help track your deviation bank. You can enter your starting deviation bank / hotel bank.
                    If entered correctly the tool should manage deviation bank. Knowing your current bank is half the battle.
                    You can enter individual expenses for a month or sum them into one entry. The same goes for trip banks.
                    If you earn hotel bank, be sure to update that information. This tool is still new, so some bugs exist.
                    Also, information will be wiped if you erase your website history, so be sure to note your deviation 
                    bank. A future version will have the ability to save information long term.
